Game of Life - Pygame
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The game consists of a grid of cells that evolve over time according to simple rules based on the number of neighbors they have. This implementation is built using Python and Pygame.

Features

Interactive Grid: Click to toggle cells between alive and dead.

Automatic Evolution: Press the spacebar to start and stop the automatic generation updates.

Customizable Grid Size: Easily changeable grid size based on your preference.

Patterns: Watch dynamic patterns form as the cells evolve.

How to Play

Click on the grid to toggle the cells between alive (white) and dead (black).

Press the spacebar to start or stop the automatic evolution of the grid.

Watch patterns emerge as the grid updates every generation.

Adjust the grid size by modifying the block_count variable in the code.
